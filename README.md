# National University Student Intelligent Vehicle Competition - SJTU Campus Selection

This repository contains the codebase for the Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU) campus selection competition of the National University Student Intelligent Vehicle Competition. The repository includes hardware setup, peripheral connections, and code implementation for the competition.

## Software Program
The software program includes the following features:

- Track Line Following: The vehicle is designed to follow the track lines using a line following algorithm.
- Roundabout Recognition: The vehicle is capable of recognizing and navigating roundabouts on the track.
- Crossroad Recognition: The vehicle can identify and navigate through crossroads on the track.
- Three-Way Intersection Recognition: The vehicle is equipped to recognize and navigate three-way intersections on the track.

## Principle
The entire program is based on the principle of track line following and line filling. The vehicle's navigation is achieved through a combination of line following and line filling algorithms.

## Availability
The complete code repository will be open to the public after April 13th, 2024.
